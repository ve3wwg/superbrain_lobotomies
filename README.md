SuperBrain Lobotomies
---------------------

These are some files related to a series of CP/M posts that  I
contributed in 1994 about the Intertec Data Systems Superbrain model 30.

The text files of the posts to com.os.cpm are preserved in the
subdirectory ./articles.

The EPROM source code, listing and hex files are found in the ./eprom subdirectory.

Enjoy, Warren.
