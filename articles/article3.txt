Subject: SuperBrain Lobotomies: #3 EPROM Rev 1
Date: 26 Oct 94 03:48:43 GMT

In  the last few posts, I covered the SuperBrain's hardware,
then  the  EPROM  socket  lobotomy and lastly doing a "brain
dump" -- ie. dumping the EPROM to file EPROM_SB.DAT.

The  objective  after  having the EPROM socket normalized to
Intel  pursuasion,  and after having the EPROM contents in a
file  that  could be duplicated or disassembled, I was ready
for my next lobotomy:

I wanted to ween my SuperBrain off of 35 track drives.  Even
if  I  gave it a double sided 40 track drive, it was too shy
to venture out to tracks 35 - 39.  Disassembly was required.


Patch revision 1:
-----------------

I  wish I could post the disassembled code here, but I don't
want  to run afoul of copyright laws here.  However, I think
code fragments are ok.  This helps our discussions.

The first revision corrected the 35 track short coming.  The
comments  are  of  course  my  own,  but each comment ";" is
followed by  a hexidecimal address of the EPROM location for
that  instruction,  which preceeds the comment itself.  Your
EPROM milage  may  vary since several SuperBrain models were
manufactured. However, I suspect they are all very similar.

The original code was like this:

        ...conversion of drive # to bits 4 - 2...
;
;       A HAS DRIVE BIT, IN BITS 5 THROUGH 1 (BIT 1 = A, BIT 2 = B ETC.)
;
L0064:  AND     01EH            ; 0064  MASK OUT DRIVE BIT
        LD      (8803H),A       ; 0066  STUFF DRIVE BITS INTO 8803
;
        LD      A,(8805H)       ; 0069  TRACK NO. (IN ONES COMPLEMENT)
        CPL                     ; 006C  TRACK NO. NOW POSITIVE
        SBC     A,23H           ; 006D  MINUS 35 TRACKS
        JP      M,L007E         ; 006F  JUMP IF FIRST SIDE
;
        CPL                     ; 0072  DIFF IN 1'S CPL NOW
        LD      (8805H),A       ; 0073  MODIFY 8805 TO HOLD CYL NO. NOW
;
;       BIT 5 = HEAD SELECT (SELECT OTHER SIDE)
;
        LD      A,(8803H)       ; 0076
        OR      20H             ; 0079  BIT 5 SELECTS OTHER SIDE
        LD      (8803H),A       ; 007B  SAVE IN 8803
L007E:  LD      A,(8803H)       ; 007E  GET CYL NO.
        OR      01H             ; 0081  BIT 0 = 1 IN 8803 BYTE
        OUT     (10H),A         ; 0083  SELECT DRIVE??

Keep  in  mind  that  the  floppy disk controller Z80 has an
inverting buffer between it and the FDC controller, so a lot
of  things must  be  1's  complemented, which  really  makes
things confusing to look at!

The basic problem concerns the code fragment:

        LD      A,(8805H)       ; 0069  TRACK NO. (IN ONES COMPLEMENT)
        CPL                     ; 006C  TRACK NO. NOW POSITIVE
        SBC     A,23H           ; 006D  MINUS 35 TRACKS
        JP      M,L007E         ; 006F  JUMP IF FIRST SIDE

Since  track  #35  is  really  Track 0, side 2 on a 35 track
machine,  this code segment  takes a track # from 0 - 69 and
converts it to a cylinder # (location 8805H) and side # (bit
7  in  location  8803H).  To  change  to  a  40 track drive,
requires the following simple modification:

        LD      A,(8805H)       ; 0069  TRACK NO. (IN ONES COMPLEMENT)
        CPL                     ; 006C  TRACK NO. NOW POSITIVE
***     SBC     A,28H           ; 006D  MINUS 40 TRACKS
        JP      M,L007E         ; 006F  JUMP IF FIRST SIDE

Now  you can see why you cannot mix 'n match 35 and 40 track
double  sided drives  on  a Superbrain.  This computation is
used for all floppy drives connected to that controller.

Single  sided  drives  are unaffected of course, because the
subtraction  never plays a role in the cylinder computation.
Branch  L007E is  always  taken in this case.  So a 35 track
SINGLE sided drive could be put in drive B: for example.  Of
course,  you  should  adjust  your  DPB in  SYSBIOS.ASM  and
re-SYSGEN22 to reflect the differences in the drives.

Well, I thought that would be enough. I was anxious to leave
it  at that since my EPROM programming system is on its last
legs,  and  every  EPROM  copy, patch and new burn in, is an
adventure  all  by  itself. Not to mention, I don't like any
one  of  my  5  friendly  cats  rubbing  my  leg  while  I'm
un/plugging EPROMs in and out.

However,  Rev  1 was not the whole story.  I'll report Patch
Rev 2 in the next posting to keep this short.
